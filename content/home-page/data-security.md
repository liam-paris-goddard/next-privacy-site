We maintain commercially reasonable security measures to protect the information we collect and store from loss, misuse, destruction, or unauthorized access. Our security includes physical, administrative, and technology-based measures. We limit access to personal information to only persons who are properly identified and who possess a role or business need to access personal information. We apply commercially adopted technologies, such as encryption, data masking, and tokenization to safeguard personal information we collect and store. We also use TLS/SSL, HTTPS, or other comparable security features to protect personal information when transmitting across the Internet or other external networks. You acknowledge that no security measure or modality of data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have any security questions, please contact us at the Contact Information available in the Contact Us section.
