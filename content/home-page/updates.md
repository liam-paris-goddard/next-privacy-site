We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we update this Policy, we will notify you by posting the revised Privacy Policy on our Website. If changes materially affect your rights, our Website will contain a special notice about the changes that is provided at least 15 days before the change will be effective, and, if required by law, will prompt you for your consent for certain changes. Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified by its effective date, which you can find at the top of this Policy.
