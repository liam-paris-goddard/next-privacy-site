Our systems currently do not support Do Not Track ("DNT") mechanisms. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy. For more information about DNT, visit [www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track).
